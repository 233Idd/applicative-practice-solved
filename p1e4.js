// SPACE DATA EXERCISE 4
// Return an array of Planets' names ( :[string] ) with gravity less than 10

  // Your code goes here...
}



// === TEST YOURSELF ===
// Once you're finished run the test with "npx vitest --run p1e4"
// If the test has all tests passed, switch to the next exercise file
// If any of the tests fails, refactor the code and run the test command after you've fixed the function
